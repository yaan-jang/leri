# Leri Analytics
[Leri Analytics](https://kornmann.bioch.ox.ac.uk/leri) (leri, also termed leria) aims to provide bioinformatics services for and solutions to both academic labs and industries. Leri delivers better custom solutions in the fileds of   
- protein rational design  ([web-server](https://kornmann.bioch.ox.ac.uk/leri/services/eca.html)) 
- evolutionary coupling analysis ([web-server](https://kornmann.bioch.ox.ac.uk/leri/services/eca.html)) 
- functionally relevant residue communities ([web-server](https://kornmann.bioch.ox.ac.uk/leri/services/eca.html)) 
- protein folding *in silico* (improved from [Sibe](http://wyu.dgist.ac.kr/sibe/))  
- statistical analysis on data  
- deep learning & optimization  
- sequentially evolving neural networks (SENET) 
- NGS data analysis  
- as well as other omic data analysis.  

Now, Leri is supported by GPU to accelerate calculations in life science.
